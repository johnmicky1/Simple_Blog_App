HTML, CSS and Javascript

**HTML**
     -Stands for Hypertext Markup Language
     -It is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
    
How is HTML applied in the Simple_Blog_App
     -We have the title which tell us what the the App is about
     -Two links, that is to say, <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> and <script src="script.js"></script> to link us to CSS and           
     Javascript respectively.
     -The heading ranging from hi to h6. H1 is the biggest size of text while h6 is the smallest size 
     -The <body> tag defining the document's body. The <body> element in this app contains all the contents of an HTML document, such;
         .div tag
         .form
         .label
         .input 

In summary, HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames 
and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display.

**CSS**
     -CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
     -CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
     
Regarding this application, CSS is used for;
     -Selecting different colour types
     -Selectting allignment
     -Font size
It should hovewer be noted that for these effects to apply the CSS files must be linked to the HTML page using the <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> syntax.
CSS is very useful in styling HTML files according to the users requirements.

**Javascript**
     -JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
     -JavaScript displays;
           .timely content updates 
           .interactive maps
           .animated 2D/3D graphics
           .scrolling video jukeboxes
In summary, JavaScript is used to make your web site more dynamic and interactive in the it validates forms and how to makes different scripts 
run in response to different scenarios hence bringing life to the website.
